# Tutorial: Playwright_demo

This project is a robust *test automation framework* for web applications, using **Playwright** for browser control and **Cucumber** for writing tests in a human-readable format. It provides a complete solution for testing: from *configuring different environments* and managing the test lifecycle, to interacting with web pages through a structured **Page Object Model (POM)**. After the tests run, it generates a custom, user-friendly *HTML report* and is fully integrated with a **CI/CD pipeline** for automated execution.
